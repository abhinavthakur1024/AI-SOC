# AI-SOC: Intelligent Threat Hunting Agent

## üéØ Objective
Build an AI-driven Security Operations Center (SOC) agent that analyzes system log files and network data to detect anomalies such as failed logins, privilege escalation, and suspicious network connections.

## ‚úÖ Outcome
- Generate mock syslog data (failed logins, sudo misuse, lateral movement, etc.)
- Parse and send data into the ELK stack for visualization
- Train ML models (K-Means, Isolation Forest) on logs to detect anomalies
- Provide alerts on suspicious activities

## üõ† Skills & Tools
- **Python**: Data parsing, anomaly detection
- **ELK Stack**: Log storage, search, visualization
- **Machine Learning**: K-Means, Isolation Forest
- **Docker**: Containerized environment
